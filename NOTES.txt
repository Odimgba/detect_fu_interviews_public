# Steph Yap did a lot of work on this code. She started by forking the 
# detect_shiny_dashboard repo. I downloaded her code and created this new repo

Upload app/data to UTH server
-----------------------------

These are instructions for using the Shiny app from the UTHealth servers. 
I don't think I'm actually going to do that anymore, but I'm keeping the 
instructions just in case.

1. Connect to VPN
2. Open terminal 1
3. Type ssh mcannell@SPSHIWPLV001.sph.uthouston.edu
4. Enter UTH password
5. Open terminal 2 (local)
6. In terminal 2 type: scp path_to_file mcannell@SPSHIWPLV001.sph.uthouston.edu:~/shinyapps/
7. That will upload the file to the server
8. Switch back to terminal 1
9. Move the file you uploaded to the server to the appropriate folder
  * E.g., mv calls_per_day_w_scheduled.rds detect_dashboard
10. Change any file paths the R script by typing vi app.R
  * Type I for insert mode
  * Type esc to leave insert mode
  * Type shift+: to bring up the prompt
  * Type wq + enter to leave the editor
11. view app at shiny.sph.uth.edu/mcannell/folder_name/
  * E.g., shiny.sph.uth.edu/mcannell/detect_dashboard/

Notes:
  * If this is a new app, you will need to create a new folder on the server in the shinyapps dir.   
  * That folder will need to contain app.R. 
  * Whatever you name the folder is what will end up in the url.
