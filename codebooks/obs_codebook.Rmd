# Purpose of the program

Using the CodebookR package, we will create a data dictionary for follow-up interview data for the DETECT project.

```{r}
# Load data from APS Investigations data set
obs <- read_rds("~.../detect_public/data/obs_factor.rds") #598 184
```

# Set column attributes

```{r}
# Create a vector of column names that have the same source, in this case administrative data
admin_vars <- obs %>% 
  select(1:11) %>%  # Choose the first columns in the data frame
  names()

for(i in admin_vars) {
  attr(obs[[i]], "source") <- "Administrative data"
}
```

```{r}
# Create a vector of column names that have the same source, in this case, DETECT Screening items

obs_vars <- obs %>% 
  select(12:26) %>% # Choose the variables from the raw data
  names()

for(i in obs_vars) {
  attr(obs[[i]], "source") <- "Detection of Elder abuse Through Emergency Care Technicians (DETECT) Screening Items"
}
```

```{r}
# Create a vector of column names that have the same source, in this case Observational Measures
obs_vars <- obs %>% 
  select('hygiene':'aps_reported_method') %>% # Choose the variables from the raw data
  names()

for(i in obs_vars) {
  attr(obs[[i]], "source") <- "DETECT Follow-up Interview Questions Observational Measures"
}
```

```{r}
# Create a vector of column names that have the same description, in this case Observational Measures variables that were used in older versions of the follow-up interview
obs_vars <- obs %>% 
  select('hygiene':'aps_reported_method') %>% # Choose the variables from the raw data
  names()

for(i in obs_vars) {
  attr(obs[[i]], "description") <- "Variable used in older version of follow-up interview. Not in use in most recent protocol"
}
```

```{r}
# Create a vector of column names that have the same source, in this case Medic EM Assessment
obs_vars <- obs %>% 
  select('at_physical':'at_self_why') %>% # Choose the variables from the raw data
  names()

for(i in obs_vars) {
  attr(obs[[i]], "source") <- "Observational Measures - Medic EM Assessment"
}
```

```{r}
# Create a vector of column names that have the same source, in this case recoded factor variables
factor_vars <- obs %>% 
  select(102:184) %>%  #Choose the recoded variables
  names()

for(i in factor_vars) {
  attr(obs[[i]], "source") <- "Recoded from raw data"
}
```

```{r}
