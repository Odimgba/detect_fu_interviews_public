# DETECT Public Repository

This is the public repository for the DETECT follow-up interviews.

# Overview

Each month, MedStar treats many older adults in their homes. While they are there, they are also supposed to screen for elder mistreatment (EM) using the DETECT tool. Currently, approximately 1,600 of those screenings are being completed each month. 

Every two weeks, our call center receives a list of patients that were screened with the DETECT tool in during the previous two weeks. For example, on the 15th of March, they will receive a list of all the people who were treated by MedStar and screened with the DETECT tool between March 1 and March 14. The call center will call every person on that list and attempt to schedule them for a follow-up interview. Our inital target was 70 of these interviews per month. In reality, we average around 30. A follow-up interview will be scheduled for people who pass the initial screening and agree to participate.

A speciailly trained MedStar Community Paramedic travels to the patient's home to conduct the follow-up interviews. They typically take between 1 and 2 hours. At the end of the interview, the participant receives a $25 Wal-Mart gift card. All data is collected and stored in FileMaker Pro. This repository contains the code used to extract that data from FM Pro and process it for analysis.
